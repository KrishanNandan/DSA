1.) The "Undo" Mechanism : Almost every software (Word, Photoshop, Code Editors) uses a stack to track your changes and let's say 
    if you want to go back then you can use this to undo the changes.

2.) Browser History: Our web browser uses a stack to manage the pages you visit. When we click a link, the new URL is pushed onto the stack.
    When we hit the Back Button, the browser "pops" the current page off the stack and shows us the page that was directly underneath it.

3.) Expression Evaluation (Math) : Compilers use stacks to solve mathematical equations and check for syntax errors.
    Parentheses Matching: A stack is used to ensure every ( has a matching ). When the compiler sees (, it pushes it; when it sees ), 
    it pops the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, the code is balanced.
    Postfix/Prefix notation: Stacks help computers solve complex math like (3 + 4) * 5 by converting them into a format the CPU can process easily.
