21. What's the value of sum?
    const sum = eval('10*10+5');=>>> 105
eval evaluates code that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, 
it evaluates the expression. The expression is 10 * 10 + 5. This returns the number 105.

24. What's the output?
const obj = { 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c' };
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
obj.hasOwnProperty('1');==>true
obj.hasOwnProperty(1);==>true
set.has('1');==>false
set.has(1);==>true
All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. 
This is why obj.hasOwnProperty('1') also returns true.
It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no '1' in our set: set.has('1') returns false. 
It has the numeric type 1, set.has(1) returns true.

26. The JavaScript global execution context creates two things for you: the global object, and the "this" keyword. in the browser 
it creates window object.
Note: when we open the browser tab at that time itself window object get's created but it gets destroyed when we load another url
blank url is also considered as "" url so when it moves to another url it destroy old one

27. What's the output?
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) continue;
  console.log(i); // logs 1 2 4
}
Note: The continue statement skips an iteration if a certain condition returns true.


28. What's the output?
String.prototype.giveLydiaPizza = () => {
  return 'Just give Lydia pizza already!';
};
const name = 'Lydia';
console.log(name.giveLydiaPizza())// will log "Just give Lydia pizza already!"
String is a built-in constructor, that we can use to add properties to its prototype.

33. What's the output?
const person = { name: 'Lydia' };
function sayHi(age) {
  return `${this.name} is ${age}`;
}
console.log(sayHi.call(person, 21)); "Lydia is 21"
console.log(sayHi.bind(person, 21)); function
.bind. returns a copy of the function, but with a bound context! It is not executed immediately.
in place of bind if it would have apply then we would have got error "CreateListFromArrayLike called on non-object"

34. 8 unique falsy value in JavaScript?
false,0,-0,0n,An-empty-string,null,undefined,NaN

38. What's the output?
(() => {
  let x, y;
  try {
    throw new Error();
  } catch (x) {
    (x = 1), (y = 2);
    console.log(x);//1
  }
  console.log(x);//undefined
  console.log(y);//2 /**Because x initialize to 1 was a local variable coming from catch and y initialize was global one.
})();
 
Note: Boxing or wrapping of primitive type happens for all primitive type except "null" and "undefined"

49. What's the value of num?
const num = parseInt('7*6', 10); // 7 
Only the first number in the string is returned. Based on the radix (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), 
the parseInt checks whether the characters in the string are valid. 
Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters.
* is not a valid number. It only parses "7" into the decimal 7. num now holds the value of 7.
