72. What's the output?
console.log(String.raw`Hello\nworld`);//C: Hello\nworld
String.raw returns a string where the escapes (\n, \v, \t etc.) are ignored!

73. What's the output?
async function getData() {
  return await Promise.resolve('I made it!');
}
const data = getData();
console.log(data);Promise {<pending>}

74. What's the output?
function addToList(item, list) {
  return list.push(item);
}
const result = addToList('apple', ['banana']);
console.log(result);//will return "2" since push returns the length of the array


75. What's the output?
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };
console.log(firstName);//will throw error

87. console.log('I want pizza'[0]); // logs "I"

88. What's the output?
function sum(num1, num2 = num1) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}
sum(10);//Will log 20
You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, 
as long as they've been defined before the default parameter. We pass the value 10 to the sum function. 
If the sum function only receives 1 argument, it means that the value for num2 is not passed, and the value of num1 is equal to the passed value 10 in this case. 
The default value of num2 is the value of num1, which is 10. num1 + num2 returns 20.

89. What's the output?
// module.js
export default () => 'Hello world';
export const name = 'Lydia';
// index.js
import * as data from './module';
console.log(data);//Will log "{ default: function default(), name: "Lydia" }"
With the import * as name syntax, we import all exports from the module.js file into the index.js file as a new object called data is created


function giveLydiaPizza() {
  return 'Here is pizza!';
}
const giveLydiaChocolate = () => "Here's chocolate... now go hit the gym already.";
console.log(giveLydiaPizza.prototype);//{} will give prototype as  object
console.log(giveLydiaChocolate.prototype);undefined 
Regular functions, such as the giveLydiaPizza function, have a prototype property, 
which is an object (prototype object) with a constructor property. Arrow functions however, 
such as the giveLydiaChocolate function, do not have this prototype property. 
undefined gets returned when trying to access the prototype property using giveLydiaChocolate.prototype.
arrow functions do not have a prototype property because they were specifically designed to be non-constructible.
In JavaScript, a function can only be used with the new keyword if it has an internal method called [[Construct]] but arrow function
doesn't have this they only have [[call]] and regular have both.
